            <h4>Take a Reusable Bag</h4>
            <img src="images/reusable.png" alt="Reusable Bag" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Taking your own reusable bags can greatly help the environment as the average person uses 13,000 plastic
                bags
                over a lifetime which each can take up to 100 years to degrade and often end up in oceans killing many
                birds
                and sea animals. There is also a monetary benefit with each bag costing at least 5p. In total that adds
                up
                to a potential minimum of £650 on plastic bags over your lifetime.</p>

            <h4>Be Packaging Mindful</h4>
            <img src="images/bottle.png" alt="Plastic bottle" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Packaging that items come in is sometimes unnecessary and often useless. One example of wasteful
                packaging is
                toothpaste tubes, which are already their own container. However, most toothpaste tubes also come in
                card
                boxes which are a waste of card/paper. Also, bigger versions of items such as 2 litre bottles of cola
                will
                use less packaging per litre than a 500ml bottle does.</p>

            <h4>Buy Used</h4>
            <img src="images/thrift.png" alt="Used clothess" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Buying second hand doesn’t get eco-friendlier. Buying something that’s already been used instead of
                buying
                new is 100% eco-friendly and often some items such as furniture may have some interesting story behind
                them.
                Ikea are doing amazingly with their current 70% renewable/recycled material usage with their goal of
                100%
                renewability by 2030, but using no new materials is still better than using 100% renewable materials.
