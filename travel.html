            <p>Cycling to work can have great impacts on the environment for a few reasons, firstly you’re using no
                fossil
                fuels and secondly the lack of your car on the road can reduce the amount of traffic there is which
                means
                fewer standstills. "Cycling 10 km each way to work would save 1500 kg of greenhouse gas emissions each
                year"
                - Queensland government, Australia.</p>

            <h4>Take the Train</h4>

            <hr>
            <p>“Rail travel uses less energy per mile and per person than travelling by car does. Worldwide, road users
                account for about 71% of transport CO2 emissions.” – National Rail 2018 <br>If travelling into a city,
                taking the train will also help to reduce traffic and CO2 emissions in that area resulting in cleaner
                air in
                that space. </p>

            <h4>Reduce Your Flights</h4>
            <img src="images/plane.png" alt="Aeroplane" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Aeroplanes are a great contributor to CO2 emissions with 12% of total transport emissions coming from
                aeroplanes. Many flyers are because of business and usually travel inland rather than international. By
                taking other modes of transport such as the train or relocating staff as a business this could greatly
                help
                to reduce the number of planes required to fly by reducing the demand for flights. </p>
