            <p>Diet can help with the environment more than most people expect. Eating less meat can reduce food wastage
                as it takes more energy in the form of food to keep larger animals alive than the amount of energy they
                give back in the form of meat. Reducing meat consumption would also reduce the amount of livestock
                needed resulting in less greenhouse gas being produced.</p>

        <article id="shoppingArt">
            <p>Shopping habits can change our impact on the environment. One thing we can do is to take our own reusable
                bags for shopping, not exclusively food shopping. This helps to reduce plastic usage and reduces the
                chance of plastic making its way into the oceans. Buying second hand furniture and clothing is also a
                great way of reducing the usage of resources.</p>

            <p>Travelling and choosing the way in which we travel can greatly impact to environment. If you work locally
                and drive think about riding or walking to work when the weather is nice. If you work further away from
                home, consider carpooling with a co-worker. When travelling longer distances for events or visiting
                family, public transport could be a great alternative and you can avoid the stresses of driving. </p>
