            <h4>Eat Less Meat</h4>
            <img src="images/vegetarian.png" alt="Vegetables and Pasta" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Meat is like a black hole for resources when it comes to keeping the animals alive for consumption. Meat
                and
                dairy production use 27% of the global freshwater consumption. Of the plants we feed to cows, only 4% of
                the
                protein and 3% of the calories is converted into the meat we eat. Resulting in a loss of 97% of
                potential
                calories to feed ourselves. This is potentially world hunger ending.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Reducing waste by not buying unnecessary food items can help to reduce demand for items, such as meat,
                and
                therefore reduce the supply. By simply planning meals out in advance and creating a list of the
                ingredients
                that are required we can avoid buying unneeded items that may be thrown away. This will also result in
                saving money on food, nobody likes to throw money away.</p>

            <h4>Buy Local Produce</h4>
            <img src="images/buyLocal.png" alt="Food being bought at a market" class="floatingArtImg round">
            <hr>
            <p>Buying locally grown produce carries many benefits. For one it saves on CO2 emissions as it isnâ€™t
                transported
                across the globe. Buying locally helps to support the local economy and usually fresher and more
                flavourful
                due to it being harvested when ripe as opposed to being picked early to meet shipping dates. Because of
                the
                shorter time between harvest and consumption, local produce will also be more nutritious. </p>
